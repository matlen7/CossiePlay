    The CossiePlay family is:
    <br>
    <br>
    Steven Rogers – Steve was a Navy Seal for 37 years before getting interested in hosting parties and helping people
    enjoy their fantasies together in a family-friendly fun environment.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sally Rogers – After only 6 weeks of her first dress-making course, Sally was already designing and sewing elaborate
    ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors. 10 years later and she’s making even more amazing creations for
    happy customers.
